This repository contains Python scripts to automate the conversion of scanned invoices into Excel files. 

## Purpose

As part of my internship, I developed these tools to streamline the process of converting scanned invoices into structured Excel spreadsheets. These scripts aim to save time and improve data accuracy by automating repetitive tasks.

## How to Use

To convert scanned invoices to Excel:

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the scripts.
3. [generate your json](https://tabula.technology/)
4. modify `pdf2csv.py` to fit your needs.
5. Use the provided scripts to process your scanned invoices and generate Excel files.

## Scripts

- `pdf2gui.py`: Provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and converting PDF files.
- the rest of the scripts are called by `pdf2gui.py`.
